# Covid_Simulator-Tracker
A project for simulating covid infection. 

1. What this program do is basically we created objects representing different jobs that define their movement pattern and immunity and represent them as moving dots on a GUI map.
2. Whenever these dots contact with each other they have the probability of being infected.
3. Once infected they will either recover or die in 14 days period.
4. A counter will record the current count of infected,recovered and dead.
5. The record of contact are generated once the program is ended and can be read from log.txt.
